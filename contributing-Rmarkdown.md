# Contributing when lessons have RMarkdown files

In the lessons with Rmarkdown files (for the Data Carpentry Ecology lessons, that's just the R lesson), previewing changes and the files to push are slightly different.

- To make the changes, edit the .Rmd files. You likely will be doing this in RStudio.
- To preview those changes, knit the file
- Once you're happy with your changes, knit the file
- Push the .Rmd and the .html file that was created when it was knit to your repository

Everything else is the same for submitting a pull request.
