# Lesson Release

Repository for information on the lesson release process

## The Lesson Release Roadmap

- **Step 1.** Maintainers resolve existing PRs.  


- **Step 2.**  Freeze lessons to new significant changes.   

- **Step 3.** Have an "Issue Bonanza" to identify issues that need to be fixed before publication based on the [lesson release checklist](release-checklist.md)
  - This is a community hacky-day dedicated to creating issues and simple PRs for cleaning up the lessons.  


- **Step 4.** Maintainers organize issues (e.g. add tags and remove duplicates).

- **Step 5.** Bug BBQ to fix issues identified during Issue Bonanza.
  - This is another community hacky-day aimed at submitting PRs to fix identified issues.


- **Step 6.** Maintainers resolve final PRs

- **Step 7.** Publish!
